# MissingInteger
Find the minimal positive integer not occurring in a given sequence

Given a non-empty zero-indexed array A of N integers, returns the minimal positive integer (greater than 0) that does not occur in A.

Assume that:

N is an integer within the range [1..100,000];
each element of array A is an integer within the range [âˆ’2,147,483,648..2,147,483,647].
Complexity:

expected worst-case time complexity is O(N);
expected worst-case space complexity is O(N), beyond input storage (not counting the storage required for input arguments).
